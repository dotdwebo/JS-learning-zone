- Temporal Dead Zone
- use a constant before declaration & initialization. Result: ReferenceError
- not hoisted if variable initialized before used
- result of variable hoisting: var -> undefined, let -> ReferenceError
- Created a function hoisting
- create hoisting.js file
- Put const in function scope and got a Reference Error. As i thought.
- put let in function scope and got a Reference Error.
- var in function scope and let in block scope
- Created var and let inside function scope. Got an Reference Error on let.
- Created a hit()function and added var hey and let yoo in it.
- Created scope.js file
- Remove var before go and go becomes a function that can be called outside the main function.
- input parameter (x) and remove let inside the function.
- Removed x as a parameter in variable go. Code works.
- Got a Syntax error. An identifier 'x' has already been declared.
- added var y inside the function and called from outside the function. Got Undefined Error.
- removed the x parameter in the function, removed all variables outside the function. Defined let x inside the function. Called the variable from outside the function. Got an error.
- Commented var outside the function and uncommented let outside the function. Got an Undefined Error.
- Add parameter x in test() function without defining the variable inside the function. Got error.
- Changed let to var outside the function.
- deleted variable inside function. Function called variable outside its scope.
- deleted test2() function
- Only calling variable inside the function
- Learning Referrence Error
- Rename the function from function callx() to call(). Remove a parameter from the function. Console.log the variables and constants outside the function. Result: Success
- Create a new variable with the same name (var x)inside a function and called the function. Result: success.
- Called a variable from global scope to local scope and got error.
- Assigned new value in var x, let y, and const z. Got error in cons z. However, it's a constant, right?
- Add const z
- Add var x and y
- testing. Can i call git inside a folder? Let's try

- Rename typeCasting folder to type-casting
- create equality-comparisons folder & create README.md in its folder
- Rename dataStructure folder to data-structures
- rename datatypes folder to data-types
- rename datatypes folder to data-types
- create dataStructure folder & create README.md in its folder
- create typeCasting folder && README.md in its folder
- add info on README.md
- add README.md in variables folder
- add README.md in datatypes folder
- add README to initial commit
