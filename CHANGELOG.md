- Remove var before go and go becomes a function that can be called outside the main function.
- input parameter (x) and remove let inside the function.
- Removed x as a parameter in variable go. Code works.
- Got a Syntax error. An identifier 'x' has already been declared.
- added var y inside the function and called from outside the function. Got Undefined Error.
- removed the x parameter in the function, removed all variables outside the function. Defined let x inside the function. Called the variable from outside the function. Got an error.
- Commented var outside the function and uncommented let outside the function. Got an Undefined Error.
- Add parameter x in test() function without defining the variable inside the function. Got error.
- Changed let to var outside the function.
- deleted variable inside function. Function called variable outside its scope.
- deleted test2() function
- Only calling variable inside the function
- Learning Referrence Error
- Rename the function from function callx() to call(). Remove a parameter from the function. Console.log the variables and constants outside the function. Result: Success
- Create a new variable with the same name (var x)inside a function and called the function. Result: success.
- Called a variable from global scope to local scope and got error.
- Assigned new value in var x, let y, and const z. Got error in cons z. However, it's a constant, right?
- Add const z
- Add var x and y
