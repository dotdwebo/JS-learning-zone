# Contributing

We encourage any form of contribution, whether that be issues, comments, or pull requests. If you are going to be submitting a PR, there are a few things we would appreciate that you do to keep the codebase clean:

* **Write tests.** We enforce 100% code coverage on this repo so any new code that gets written should have accompanying tests.
* **Follow the linter.** We use our [ESLint configuration](https://github.com/lob/eslint-config-lob), and we run `npm run lint` in our Travis builds.
* **Ask questions if you aren't sure.** If you have any questions while implementing a fix or feature, feel free to create an issue and ask us. We're happy to help!
